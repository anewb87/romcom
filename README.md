# RomCom

## Abstract  
This is an application that generates random covers for romance novels.

## Project Specs

The project provides users with two ways to create these covers.  

The first is by clicking the *Show New Random Cover* button that creates a cover for the user without requiring any user input. This cover includes a cover image, a unique name, and a tagline with two unique descriptors.

Additionally, if a user is feeling creative, they can make their own cover by clicking the *Make Your Own Cover* button. They will be redirected to a form page where they can insert a url to their favorite cover/image, then add a title and two descriptors for their new cover. The form will not allow submission unless all fields are filled. When the user clicks the *Make My Book* button, they will be returned to the homepage and their new cover will be displayed.

From the main view, the user can click the *Save Cover* button at any point to save the currently displayed cover and can then head over to the *View Saved Covers* page which will display all the saved covers.

If a user decides they do not like a certain cover, they can double click on that cover to remove it from the saved covers page.
