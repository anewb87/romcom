# RomCom
### An online random romance novel cover generator.

## Description
<p>This project provides the user with a few different ways to create a random romance novel cover. The first way is by clicking a random generator button that
creates a cover for the user without needing to do anything. This cover includes a cover image, a unique name, and a tagline with two unique descriptors. A user
can then save that cover (if they like it!) and continue to create more random covers, if they so choose by using the *Show New Random Cover* button. Additionally, if a user is
feeling creative, they can make their own by clicking the *Make Your Own Cover* button. They will be redirected to a form page, where they can insert a url to their favorite cover,
a title, and two descriptors for their new creation. The form will not allow submission unless all fields are filled. When the user clicks the *Make My Book* button, they will be returned
to the homepage and their new cover will be visible. From this point, the user can click the *Save Cover* button to save their new cover, and head over to the *View Saved Covers* page, where
all saved covers can be seen in a nicely formatted order. If a user decides they do not like a certain cover, they can double click on that cover to remove it from the saved covers page.</p>
